# Time-Series-Processing-Application-to-Solve-Contemporary-Problems-

Purpose and scope
The objective is to apply time series tools to a dataset on vehicular flow through the AUSA toll plazas in Buenos Aires.

Time series
Implementation of a model to predict vehicular flow on a highway in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

The dataset contains data from 2017, 2018 and 2019.

The work is organised into three parts:
• Part A: Data exploration. Every data science project begins with exploratory data analysis. Every EDA must answer questions.
• Part B: Machine Learning Model. In this section, the learned machine learning techniques are applied to create a predictive model from the provided dataset.
• Part C: Research. The questions and things to test are endless. The purpose of this section is to encourage you to suggest how you would develop the project further, either to improve the model or to address an interesting research question.
